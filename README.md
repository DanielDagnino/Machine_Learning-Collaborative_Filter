This is an example of a collaborative filter.
It uses a data base of movie scores that contains several user and then, applying a collaborative filter it predicts new user scores for the unscored movies. The data bases I have used is free at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ and it contains millions of user scores for a large amount of movies.
The collaborative filter used is a version based in the algorithms discribed at

and the minimization method is based in a boost gradient.
